## Description
This is a web application that takes a ``user's birthday``,calculates the ``day of the week`` they were born
and the depending on there gender out puts there ``akan name``.

Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their 
first name as a ``day name`` which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names.

##### Male
Sunday: Kwasi

Monday: Kwadwo

Tuesday: Kwabena

Wednesday: Kwaku

Thursday:  Yaw

Friday: Kofi

Saturday: Kwame

##### Female
Sunday: Akosua

Monday: Adwoa

Tuesday: Abenaa

Wednesday: Akua

Thursday:  Yaa

Friday: Afua

Saturday: Ama

Most people do know when their birthdays are, but some might not know what day ofthe week they were born. 
Luckily for us, there are ways to calculate the day of the week from a specific date. The following is one of
the many methods that exist for that;

## BDD

Day of the week (d) = ( ( (CC/4) -2*CC-1) + ((5*YY/4) ) + ((26*(MM+1)/10)) + DD ) mod 7

  |Inputs |  Description |
| :---        |              ---:|
|CC        |is the century digits, ``e.g 1989 has CC = 19``|
|YY       |is the year digits, ``e.g 1989 has YY = 89``|
|MM        |is the month of the year,``e.g 5th month`` |
|DD       |is the day of the month ``e.g 24th day`` |
|mod    |is the modulous function, ``%``    |
